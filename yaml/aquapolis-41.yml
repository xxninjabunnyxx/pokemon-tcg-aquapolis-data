  text: As long as Umbreon is your Active Pokémon and has a Darkness Energy attached
    to it, once during your turn (before your attack), you may look at your opponent's
    hand. Choose from it a number of cards up to the number of Darkness Energy attached
    to Umbreon and shuffle them into your opponent's deck. Your opponent then draws
    the same number of cards from his or her deck. This power can't be used if Umbreon
    is affected by a Special Condition.
